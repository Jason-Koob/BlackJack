# BlackJack
My Blackjack Python program.

## How It Works
I made a list of the possible cards and labeled it 'tCards'. This list is used heavily throughout the blackjack game.
I relied on Python's random module to randomly choose a item from the list.
The item would then be given a value regardless if it was a face-card or numeric card. The value of cards held is combined and shown to the user.
